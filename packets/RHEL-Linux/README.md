If you haven’t learned vi or vim, it’s highly recommended that you do. It’s one of the few editors ALWAYS guaranteed to be installed on a RHEL system.

On any RHEL system, you can type “vimtutor” (without quotes) at the command line, and run the VIM tutorial.

Labs
If you were issued a Windows machine (and even if you weren’t), make sure you can log into sh-el6.eng.rdu2.redhat.com using your Kerberos ID.  
This is a simple shell box for all Red Hat associates.  You can use this to practice or to run things like vimtutor.
